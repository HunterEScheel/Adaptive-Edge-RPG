# What is Adaptive Edge? Why use it?

- Adaptive Edge is a linear progression TTRPG D20 system with a reactive combat system and high customizability without all the extra bloat that often comes with it. Unlike many others, Adaptive Edge is a system of constant advancement. Your players can advance at different rates without an immediate power gap between them. Key differences between this system and ones you’ve likely played are:
- There are no classes in Adaptive Edge. Anyone can cast spells. This should lead to more creative paths for character.
- Adaptive Edge features an attribute-based roll system, where
  Players choose “Skills” they want to invest into. When calling for a roll, you tell the player which Base Attribute to roll and the player will attempt to justify using one or more of their skills to give that roll a bonus
- As a GM, you can and should modify the DC of the roll depending on how relevant the skills are. It is at your sole discretion whether a skill is applicable for a given roll
- Adaptive Edge features a highly reactive combat system, where your initiative matters less but your choices matter more. See the Combat Rules document for more information

## Session 0

In session 0, you need to set the ground rules for the kind of game you’ll be running. Read through the 4 Rules sections and get a good understanding of how each is used. Pay attention to the mechanics for Flaws, Skills, and Tethers. Your job is to provide a clear rewards system for your players playing in-character, including exhibiting their weaknesses. The simplest reward you can give is extra Build Points.

### Before Character Creation

Here are the limitations and requirements you need to clarify with your players before they begin making their characters:

#### What is the Build Point allowance?

- For Tier 0 play, give a negative BP allowance so they need to take flaws and/or downgrade attributes to meet the requirement).
- For Tier 1 play, 100 BP should get them a few skills, spells, and abilities without having to downgrade anything
- For Tier 2, anywhere from 400-600BP should allow your players to upgrade anything they may need.
- For Tier 3, 700-1000BP is appropriate
- For Tier 4, good luck!

#### What is the limit on Flaws?

Talk with each player about whether they think their flaws will have a positive or negative impact on the game. If their flaws will make the game less fun for other players (including you, the GM) you should discuss with your player and come to an agreement

#### What is the minimum Obligation requirement for Tethers?

Some players will want to avoid this, but it’s the most important tool in the entire system for you as a GM. Tethers should be what drives a player character. These Tethers should be in mind as you write your main storyline, if you have one. A player writing down a tether is an acknowledgement that their character either cares about it, or that they should have reason to care (and be punished for ignoring it)

#### Special Abilities

Talk to your players about what special abilities you’ll be allowing, what you won’t be allowing, and why. Keep in mind that energy points exist for a reason. They’re a limited resource. Try to keep the number of once/day or once/LR abilities to a minimum. Instead, assign an EP cost to using the ability so they have to choose whether to use that ability or cast a spell
