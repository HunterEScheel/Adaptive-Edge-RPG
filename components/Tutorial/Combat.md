# Combat

## Weapons

Each weapon has an Attribute(STR or DEX) and a combination of Heft(2-Handed, 1-Handed, Versatile, Unarmed) and Type(Swing, Stab, Fire, Draw). when attacking with a weapon, a player will add their associated attribute along with their skill in the selected Heft-Type to a D20 roll. if they meet the opponent's Evasion level, they hit. you may also expend Energy Points for a +X to hit, where X is the energy points you expended. This is a one-time bonus and must be applied before you roll to hit

EX: Jordy has 2 levels of 2-handed Swing weapons, a STR of 4, and rolled a 12 against an enemy with an Evasion of 15. 12 + 4 + 2 = 18, so he hits

## Dodge/Evasion

Dodge is your passive defensive skill, representing your expertise in avoiding being hit. Your Evasion level is equal to 10 plus Dexterity plus your "Dodge" skill. Armor does not increase evasion, but might reduce it.

## Parry

Parry is your active defensive skill. You may "Parry" an attack using an action if within range to parry with your weapon, reducing its roll to hit by 1d4 + your Parry Skill level. This parry action may only be rolled before you know the result of the attack roll

## Armor

Armor has 4 important stats:

- Durability - how many "heavy hits" your armor can take before breaking
- Damage Reduction - how much damage your armor prevents from hitting you
- Evasion Reduction - how much less evasive your armor makes you
- Damage Threshold - the amount of damage that must be dealt to the armor to reduce its durability

Armor has a damage reduction X, where incoming attacks are reduced by X damage. Each time an attack exceeds the Damage Threshold of your armor, the Durability of the armor decreases by 1 until it hits 0. When it hits 0, the armor is considered broken and provides no benefit, but still reduces your Evasion level until taken off. Armor provides a negative modifier to your Evasion level, depending on heft

## On Your Turn

Use any number of actions and/or movement you have remaining
Your actions have priority over those of others - excluding “response” actions
At the end of your turn, your actions and movement are reset (3 actions, 2 movement)

## Other Characters’ Turns

You may use up to 1 action and 1 movement
You may attempt to use a “response” type action - interjecting yourself into another player’s action (ex: Counterspell)

## What is an action?

Anything you might regularly do in combat that isn’t movement counts as an action.
Casting a spell
Attacking
Drinking a Potion
Hiding
Etc.

## What is a “Response” action?

### Readied Responses

Note: If you wish for your readied response to interrupt or disable the target, you must specify this when readying the response
You can ready an Action or movement, attempting to “interject” into another action. You specify:
A target.
A trigger
Your action
Readied Response Examples include Forced movement, Distractions, Flanking, and Attacks.

### Other Responses

Certain responses do not need to be readied, such as
Protective fighting styles
Parrying
Counterspells
