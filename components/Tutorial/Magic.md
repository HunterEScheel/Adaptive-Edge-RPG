# Attributes

What is an attribute?
When calling for a roll, the Game Master will call for an Attribute, and a player adds their attribute score to that roll. Attributes are on a -5 to +5 system, with the default score for each attribute being 0. Attributes are as follows:
Strength(STR)
Dexterity(DEX)
Constitution(CON)
Intelligence(INT)
Focus(FOC)
Charisma(CHA)

## How do I increase my Attribute Scores?

Attributes Boosts cost 50 BP (Build Points) per level increased, and decreasing an attribute refunds this 50BP. Default Values are all set at 0, with a minimum score of -5 and a maximum score of 5

# Skills(non-combat)

Skills may be anything under the sun (Stealth, Escape, Lobotomy, Lifting, Piloting, etc) that represents scenarios where your character thrives, with the cost depending on the level you take in that skill. These skills are added when applicable to an Attribute roll called for by the GM. As a player, you should look for opportunities to justify adding these skills to your rolls, then present your justification to your GM and they will tell you whether itâ€™s applicable enough. You may add multiple applicable skills to a single roll.
