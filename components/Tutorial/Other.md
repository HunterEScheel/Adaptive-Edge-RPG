# Energy & HP

Energy Points(EP) are your ability to put forth extra effort. This can be casting spells, Special abilities, or just pouring extra effort into a combat strike. Increasing your maximum EP costs 2 BP per 3 EP, and you start at 10

HP is your ability to take a hit without falling unconscious. Increasing your Max HP costs 2BP per 1HP. Your maximum HP at character creation is 5 + (5 \* CON)

# Abilities & Passives

Some abilities may give your character non-intuitive advantages or characteristics that are not addressable in a calculation system. Ask your GM about the BP cost for these abilities. Generally, it is advised to lean into skills instead of specialized Abilities where possible so you have an easier time tracking your character

# Flaws

These are areas where your character has trouble. They can be categorized anywhere from “Quirks” to “Flaws” to “Vices”. Adding a flaw will give you back some amount of BP, based on the category of the flaw. Ask your GM about what the expectations and rewards are for playing out these flaws and choose flaws that add to the story, not remove from it.

# Tethers

Tethers are how your character feels about the world, and how the world feels about your character. They represent interactions and core traits or connections to your character prior to the adventure. They dictate why your backstory matters and what elements of it may come up in the future. Ask your GM about what rewards might be in place for chasing and “resolving” these tethers. Your GM will set a minimum “Obligation” for the characters you create. Each Tether has an “Obligation level” and you may be expected to proactively chase these tethers in-character depending on their obligation level. Choose Tethers that you as a player will care about. If you only care about combat, choose tethers that are likely to resolve in combat. For example, if you have family debt to a loan shark, you may have family members taken hostage and given a deadline. Your character will be expected to actually care.
